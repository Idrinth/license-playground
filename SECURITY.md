# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The latest feature version of each license is supported by default. Security
issues in this case mean legal issues, meaning fixing them likely requires a
version change by everyone affected.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please use the bug issue for that and provide as much information as possible.
Since there is no lawyer on hand, we will make a best effort to fix any issue
but can't guarantee for that change's effectiveness.
