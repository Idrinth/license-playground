# Contributing

This is a playground, more people means more fun, ideas and better results,
therefore everyone is invited to participate.

## Issues

Issues are there to raise discussion topics, please make sure to have one
for anything bigger than typo changes or clarifications before you raise a
pull request.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are actual changes done to the licences and the tooling. Make
sure to follow the guidelines in regards to what file to update when you
make changes to existing licenses:

- Anything not breaking the intention is a change to the existing file
- Anything adding to or modifying the intention is a new feature version
  and has been put into it's own directory
- Any major change is a new license or if similar a major version of an
  existing license, that belongs in it's own directory
- All changes to intention have been added to the README to make the choice
  of license version easier for maintainers
