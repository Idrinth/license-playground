# FUARP License

The Free Usage And Restricted Profiteering license is meant to enable classic open source freedoms primarily.
It allows free use for most purposes, just limits direct profiteering from the contributor's work by third
parties by introducing a license fee for works that are in large parts dependant on the project itself when
sold.
